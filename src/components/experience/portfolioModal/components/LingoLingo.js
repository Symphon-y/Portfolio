          Our team was tasked with the development and design of an online
          language exchange platform consisting of a forum, chat feature, and
          event scheduler. The forum allows the user to ask questions related to
          a language they would like to learn. The chat feature allows users to
          directly message one another and the event scheduler allows users to
          schedule events and add them directly to the communtiy calendar.

            to interact.

            they are interested in, and the ability to start a chat with that
            user. The user will have the ability to add other users to their
